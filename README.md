# Native-Grass-Substrate-Project
University of Florida - Forests, Fisheries, & Geomatic Sciences - Environmental Horticulture - UF Native Plant Nursery 
**Project Overview:** Research project conducted in 2022 at the UF Native Plant Nursery measuring the growth performance of three native grasses across four container substrates. 
**Goal of Project:** The goal of the project is to determine if the growth performance of native grasses found in differing natural habitats are affected by container substrates that in turn differ drastically in terms of physical characterstics, composition, and costs.
**Data Source:** Growth peformance data includes max average growth height, breaking point height, number of clumps, visual quality of roots/shoots, mass of roots & shoots, as well asnotes indicating individual plants that were selected for photographs. Plants were harvested on 05/18/2022 at which time all data except root/shoot mass was collected. Root/shoot data was collected two-weeks following harvest and oven drying period. Data was collect via paper data-sheets and transcribed to google sheets, and downloaded as two seperate .csv files, one being mass data and the other height/visual quality data. 
**Data Output**: All data cleaning and anaylsis were peformed in R Studio via one R project and two R scripts.
